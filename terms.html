               competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets,
               patents or other intellectual property rights. You acknowledge and agree that you and Company are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to
               participate as a plaintiff or class User in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and Company otherwise agree
               in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative
               proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void. Except as

            </p>
            <p>
               Arbitration Rules and Governing Law. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the Commercial
               Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute
               Resolution” section. (The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/arb_med or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern
               the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.
            </p>
            <p>
               Arbitration Process. A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA
               Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175 and a separate form for Washington residents at
               www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015822.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of
               Washington and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator
               within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.
            </p>
            <p>
               Arbitration Location and Procedure. Unless you and Company otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim
               does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Company submit to the arbitrator, unless you
               request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by
               the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent
               with the expedited nature of the arbitration.
            </p>
            <p>
               <u>Arbitrator’s Decision.</u>
               The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and
               conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The
               arbitrator’s award damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for
               which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary
               to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. The prevailing party in arbitration will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and
               expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law.
            </p>
            <p>

               Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules.

            <p>
