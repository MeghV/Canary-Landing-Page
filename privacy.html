                <p>
                    Registering with the Service, requires certain information such as: (1) personally identifiable information, which is information that identifies Users
                    personally, including but not limited to Users' first and last name, email address, home address, date of birth and phone number ("Personal

                    the recommendation, the recommendation verification number, and the details of any orders placed through the Service ("Usage Information"). The Company
                    may collect this information through various forms and in various places on the Service, including if User(s) register for an account, through "contact
                    us" forms, or when User(s) otherwise interact with the Service in any way. If the Company combines Demographic Information with the Personal Information the Company collects directly from User(s) on the Service, the Company may, but is not required to, treat the combined data as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. All Personal Information collected by the Company is proprietary information, and is the property of the Company.
